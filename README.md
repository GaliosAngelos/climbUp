# climbUp

Denmarkproject

This is our react-native app.

This project revolves around the creation of an innovative climbing app designed to simplify the tracking and recording of climbers' progress. Faced with the existing challenges in documenting climbing routes and the scarcity of suitable applications in the market, there was a pressing need to develop this app. The primary aim of the project was to build a mobile application enabling climbers to log and monitor their advancements on routes across various climbing facilities. Moreover, the app sought to empower gym proprietors to manage and update their route databases seamlessly.

To achieve these objectives, React Native with JavaScript was employed for app development, leveraging its cross-platform capabilities to efficiently develop both Android and iOS versions of the app. The app relied on a PostgreSQL database hosted on a Debian instance on Google Cloud Platform to store gym data, user data and user progress. This cloud-based infrastructure ensured scalability and reliability for handling user data.

The project culminated in the successful creation of a functional prototype of the app, effectively realizing all predefined objectives. Although the automatic route recommendation feature for enhancing climbing skills remains pending, the app already delivers substantial value to climbers and gym administrators alike.

Looking ahead, future endeavors may include further enhancements, such as integrating machine learning algorithms to analyze climbed routes and offer personalized recommendations for improving users' climbing proficiency. Such extensions hold the promise of refining the app's functionality and enriching the overall climbing experience.
